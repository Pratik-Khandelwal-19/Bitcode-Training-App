Back Data Passing Using Protocol Delegate Pattern
There are 2 ViewControllers used in this project
First ViewController has no data there at the time when app gets opened. First ViewController shows Welcome Page & '+'sign at top right taken from Navigation Bar Button Item when app gets opened. '+' when clicked takes us to Second ViewController.
First ViewController has 4 labels for receiving data from Second ViewController.
Second ViewController has 4 TextFields for Entering Student Details & one Save Button Action.
Save Button when clicked, ensures data is saved or not by showing Alerts as Completed or Dismissed.
There is another swift file used for Protocol Back Data Passing.
