Back Data Passing Using Protocol Delegate Pattern.
There are 2 ViewControllers on Main i.e. StoryBoard in this Project. First ViewController is Root ViewController as there is an Navigation Controller embeded with it.
First ViewController has a Collection View in that there is an Collection Viewcell having 4 Labels for receiving data from Second ViewController. In First ViewController there is no data present at the time when app gets opened. First ViewController shows Welcome Page & '+'sign present at top right taken from Navigation Bar Button Item when app gets opened. '+' when clicked takes us to Second ViewController.
Second ViewController has 4 TextFields for Entering Student Details & one Save Button Action.
Save Button when clicked, ensures data is saved or not by showing Alerts as Completed or Dismissed.
There is another swift file used for Protocol Back Data Passing.
